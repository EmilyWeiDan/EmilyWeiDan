| ***Question*** | ***Answer*** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **My name is:** | Emily Wei |
| **What do I look like?** |<img src="assignment 1.jpg" alt="me" height="150" /> |
| **My major:** | I am majoring in **Neuroscience** at Dalhousie🧠! I'm also doing a minor in *Business*👔 and a certificate in *Neuroinnovative Technology*💻.|
| **My program year:** | I'm in my **3rd year** of my Bachelor of Science🧪! |
| **Why I enrolled in NESC3505?** | I'm doing an independent research project with Dr. Newman this year and he thought this course would be really helpful in helping to analyze data in the lab! I also really enjoy coding and knew some *Java*☕ so thought it would be fun to learn *Python* too🐍. |
| **Why am I interested in Neuroscience?** | When I first applied to Dalhousie🐯, I was actually planning to do ~~nursing~~ and didn't change my mind until the first day of classes. I knew I wanted more course options than nursing could offer me and decided to do a BSc instead! When choosing my major, I think neuroscience was a ***no-brainer***😹(pun not-intended but appreciated)! I had always found the brain interesting, especially how there is so much more to be discovered and how there will probably always be more to know. I was also considering going into computer science and felt like neuroscience was the perfect mix of science and artficial intelligence🦿! |
| **Plans for the future?** | I hope to go to **medical school**🩺! I just wrote the MCAT this past summer so fingers crossed!! |
